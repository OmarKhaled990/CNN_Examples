# CNN_Examples
In this repo, I collected some useful examples on how to use CNN Model for Image Recognition and Classification, and some books that will help you understand more about the usage of CNN Architecture.


# Books Names(I couldn't provide the actual books due to their copyrights):

1-[Grokking Machine Learning](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/grokking-machine-learning/9781617295911/)

2-[AI and Machine Learning for Coders](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-and-machine/9781492078180/)

3-[Grokking Artificial Intelligence Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-artificial-intelligence-algorithms)

# What to do next?

I recommend to search more and go deeper in Neural Networks to understand more about how the CNN works and going deeper in the activation functions and optimizers types.
